<h3>(1) Funeral Blues:-</h3>
<h4>Beautiful Poem used in this movie:</h4>

<p> "Stop all the clocks, cut off the telephone,<br />
    Prevent the dog from barking with a juicy bone,<br />
    Silence the pianos and with muffled drum<br />
    Bring out the coffin, let the mourners come.<br />
</p>
    
<p> Let aeroplanes circle moaning overhead<br />
    Scribbling on the sky the message ‘He is Dead’.<br />
    Put crepe bows round the white necks of the public doves,<br />
    Let the traffic policemen wear black cotton gloves.<br />
</p>
    
<p> He was my North, my South, my East and West,<br />
    My working week and my Sunday rest,<br />
    My noon, my midnight, my talk, my song;<br />
    I thought that love would last forever: I was wrong.<br />
</p>
    
<p> The stars are not wanted now; put out every one,<br />
    Pack up the moon and dismantle the sun,<br />
    Pour away the ocean and sweep up the wood;<br />
    For nothing now can ever come to any good".<br />

<h3>(3) Spring Morning:-</h3>
<h4>Beautiful Poem used in this movie:</h4>

<p>"If you were a bird, and lived on high,<br />
You’d lean on the wind when the wind came by.<br />
You’d say to the wind when it took you away,<br />
That’s where I wanted to go today!<br />

Down to the wood where the bluebells grow,<br />
Anywhere, anywhere, I don’t know".<br />
